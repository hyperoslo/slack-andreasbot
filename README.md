# Andreasbot for Slack

![Andreas is typing...](http://i.imgur.com/U1SH06d.gif])

## Usage

`$ andreasbot`

Andreasbot requires `ANDREASBOT_API_TOKEN` to be set in your environment
variables. [Create a bot](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot) on your
Slack account to get one.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git
commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset) if you
can't get it to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.

## I love Hyper

I work at [Hyper](https://github.com/hyperoslo) with a bunch of awesome folks
who are every bit as passionate about building things as I am. If you're using
Andreasbot, we probably want to hire you.
